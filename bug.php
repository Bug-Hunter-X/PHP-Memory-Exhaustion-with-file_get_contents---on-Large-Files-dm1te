This code suffers from a potential issue related to improper handling of large files.  The `file_get_contents` function reads the entire file into memory at once.  If the file is significantly large, this can lead to memory exhaustion, resulting in a fatal error or unexpected behavior.  The script might crash or become unresponsive, especially on systems with limited memory resources.
